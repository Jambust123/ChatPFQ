## Envrionment variables

You will need the following .env files to run this application:
````
.env.test
.env.development
.env.production
````
In those env files you should have a variable named MONGODB_URI, with the connection string to your database.

For example:
````
MONGODB_URI=`mongodb://localhost:00000/?directConnection=true`
````

Instructions for connecting to a MongoDB in Node.js can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/connection/connect/).

##Â Seeding the prod database

The database enforces unique values for usernames by adding a username index to the users collection.

The tests will seed the test and development databases, but not the prod database.

You will need to run npm run seed-prod to set up the prod databases, with unique value enforcement, otherwise this enforcement will not work as expected.
